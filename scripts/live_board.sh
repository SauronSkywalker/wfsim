# the library, every row it owes into the queue and opened as a compute order
# (`ship_queue.sh`) — the rows `scores` gained are read, and the boards move:
# `verified/`, `scores` alone, pushed to R2 for the site; `board/`, with every
# client result not yet a fact, for the owner and the bot. New first results are
# ranked each cycle; the server's own orders settle in a loop beside it
# (`live_orders.mjs`). docs/BOARD.md §"Compute orders", §"The live board".
