"""The names the fissure page reads, in English and Chinese: `worker/world_names.json`.

DE's world state names a fissure by ids — `SolNode717`, `MT_SURVIVAL`,
`VoidT6` — and this table turns each into the words the game shows. Every
string is DE's own, transcribed from its localization dictionaries through
`browse.wf/warframe-public-export-plus` (docs/DATA_SOURCES.md), joined by the
dictionary key and never by name.

Usage:
  python scripts/world_names.py      fetch into vendor/export-plus/, write the table

Run it again when DE adds nodes: a node the table lacks shows its id.
