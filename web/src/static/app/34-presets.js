// ---- Presets ----------------------------------------------------------
// Every preset collection is owned by one of the three modules or by an EDITOR
// that feeds them, and its DOMAIN id is "<owner>-<collection>" — `rivens` alone
// is the owner name by itself, because that editor is ALL collection and there
// is no second one to tell it apart from. Every durable name derives from the
// domain mechanically, and full words only:
//
//   localStorage  wfsim-presets-<domain>                 the list (customs: wfsim-customs-)
//                 wfsim-preset-active-<weapon>-<domain>  the active pointer
//   DOM id        preset-bar-<domain>
//
// ONE LIST PER COLLECTION, and each entry carries its `scope` — the weapon,
// frame, companion or riven family it is about (`entryScope`). A preset still
// BELONGS TO ONE WEAPON: the READ filters by scope, so edits on the Laetum never
// show up on the Dual Toxocyst. There is no copy ACROSS weapons: what survives a
// rescope is the mods every gun shares, and a build worth having comes from the
// board or from a share link. No count cap: presets live in the reader's
// localStorage rather than with us.

// The enemy, its level, Steel Path, the wielder's state, the duration and how
// many runs describe a FIGHT, and a fight is not about any particular gun —
// which the OFFICIAL rulers always were: one `standard_single_target` applies to every
// weapon on the board.
//
// It NARROWS "nothing crosses between weapons" rather than weakening it. That
// rule exists because a BUILD, a SEARCH and a RIVEN are statements about one
// weapon, and inheriting the last weapon's is how you measure a gun you are not
// looking at. A fight is no such statement, so there is nothing to inherit
// wrongly — and the one weapon-scoped knob it still holds, headshot %, is
// handled the way the rulers handle it: the SERVER forces 0 on a weapon that
// cannot headshot.
// …and a TARGET is not a weapon's either, for exactly the reason a fight is
// not: an enemy you built has no opinion about what is shooting it. Same
// consequence — one list for the whole roster.

/// …and a RIVEN, which is ABOUT a family and not FILED under one.
///
/// A STORE IS ADDRESSED BY WHAT IT IS AND FILTERED BY WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
/// Content data has no business being a storage address: a key computed from
/// `riven_family` and the mod class makes correcting either one MOVE everybody's
/// saved cards to an address the page no longer computes. So the store is one
