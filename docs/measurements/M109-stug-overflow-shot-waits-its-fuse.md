# M109 — a Stug shot carrying more stacks than the cap waits out its fuse (owner, 2026-10-03) ⚠ OPEN

*Protocol and setup: [MEASUREMENTS.md](../MEASUREMENTS.md). Cross-references `M<n>` are files in this folder.*

**THE REPORT**, the owner's, translated from Chinese:

> When multishot is high — above 10 on the base form, above 5 on the Incarnon
> form — one stack does not detonate; it has to wait 1.5 s. Damage is
> swallowed: the explosion's damage is missing. And the stack count should
> follow the same rule as the Grimoire's multishot-buys-more-enemies count.

**WHAT THE WIKI STATES** (Stug page, verbatim):

- "Fires blobs that stick to surfaces or embed into enemies, with a lifespan
  of 1.5 seconds."
- "After reaching 10 stacks or the lifespan running out, the blob will
  detonate and deal 75 - 750 damage in a 0.3 - 2.8 meter radius, scaling with
  the number of stacks."
- "Blobs can be stacked by consecutively shooting one spot, refreshing the
  blob duration with each new stack added." · "Blobs which reach 10 stacks now
  immediately explode."
- "Multishot will not shoot additional blobs, but will instead shoot blobs
  with an equivalent amount of extra stacks. For example, +100% multishot will
  cause each blob shot to have 2 stacks, reaching max stacks after only 5
  consecutive shots."
- Incarnon form: "embedding Corrosive shots that explode after 1.5 seconds or
  reaching max stacks", "can stack up to 5 times before exploding".

**HOW THE REPORT READS AGAINST THEM.** The early detonation fires when a pile
REACHES the cap by stacking. A single shot whose own stacks already exceed the
cap (multishot over 10, or over 5 in Incarnon form) never steps through the
cap, so it does not detonate early; it waits the 1.5 s lifespan, and what is
over the cap is lost. The Grimoire's rule is `floor(3 x multishot)` bodies,
measured (M63) — so the proposal is that a shot's stacks are
`floor(multishot)`, not a roll on the fraction.

**WHAT THE ENGINE DOES WITH IT.** The reading above is built as stated, ahead of
the session below (docs/MECHANICS.md §7.3): `floor` stacks a shot, a pile that
reaches the cap goes off at once and pays the cap, a shot already over the cap
holds the pile at the cap and waits, and every stack refreshes the 1.5 s
lifespan. The Incarnon form's bounces and the charged alternate fire are still
unmodelled.

**WHAT THE SESSION SETTLES**, and each answer that differs moves a rule above, one session on a Simulacrum target,
damage numbers on, unmodded but for multishot:

1. **The count.** Base form, multishot 1.0 / 1.6 / 2.0 / 2.4: how many stacks
   one shot lays (the explosion's size and radius say it). `floor` means 1.6
   always lays one; a roll means it sometimes lays two.
2. **The overflow.** Multishot 12 on the base form (and 6 in Incarnon form):
   does ONE shot detonate at once or after 1.5 s, and is the number the
   10-stack one (750) or more?
3. **The crossing.** Multishot 4: the third shot takes a pile from 8 to 12 —
   does it detonate at once, and at 10 stacks or at 12?
4. **The explosion.** Its number per stack (75 base / 200 Incarnon per the
   module), its radius per stack, and the falloff the wiki calls a UI bug
   (listed 100%-70%, said to be 100%-30%).
5. **Incarnon bounces.** How many secondary projectiles a pile of n stacks
   releases (the page says 2 to 5) and what each bounce explosion deals.
