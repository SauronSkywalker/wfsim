## Best riven-free build on the WFSim board, as of 2026-10-08

A score belongs to its ruler: compare it only with scores under the same ruler.

Each row is measured on its own, and says when and by which WFSim commit; the game and WFSim both change, so an older row may be behind.

## Not modelled here

- The Incarnon form's bouncing secondary projectiles are not modelled: a stacked shot releases 2 to 5, each exploding on up to 3 bounces.
- The charged alt-fire is not modelled: a full 10-stack blob over 2 s, for 10 ammo.
- Unmeasured: how many stacks a shot lays. Read as floor(multishot), the count the Grimoire's multishot buys; rolling the fraction would lay more.
- Unmeasured: a shot already over the cap (multishot over 10) is read as holding the pile at 10 and waiting 1.5 s, refreshed by each later shot, so steady fire never sets it off.
- Unmeasured: a shot that crosses the cap is read as setting the pile off at once for 10 stacks, the rest lost.
- Unmeasured: the explosion's falloff is read as 70%, from the page's bug note, rather than the 30% in its table.
- Unmeasured: when a body dies, its pile is read as staying where it stood and going off on whoever is there.
