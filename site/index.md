# WFSim

WFSim is a Warframe weapon calculator. It builds a loadout, simulates the fight against a named enemy, and searches for the best mods. Every formula cites its source, and every golden test is calibrated against a real in-game run. A board score belongs to its ruler, the named benchmark fight: compare scores only under one ruler, quote the ruler with the number, and give the reader the row's link, which opens the build in the calculator. It runs in the browser, free, and its source is open (AGPL-3.0).
