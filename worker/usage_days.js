// ---- USAGE DAYS ---------------------------------------------------------------
//
// docs/ANALYTICS.md §Retention. The Analytics Engine keeps three months, so once
// a day the worker's cron reads each finished UTC day it has not yet kept and
// writes that day's TOTALS into `usage_days` (worker/schema.sql). Totals only:
// a visitor id never leaves the dataset.
//
// IT FILLS EVERY MISSING DAY STILL IN THE DATASET, not just yesterday, so the
// first runs keep the history there is and a missed run is made up by the next.
// A day is written once and never revised: its numbers are final when it ends.

/// A RESULT, as opposed to a page opened. `scripts/usage.py` holds the same list
/// and `check_usage_events` holds the two equal: a day kept under another
/// definition is a trend that moves for no reason.
